Hi, I'm @OrcLord1699. I am currently studying a Bachelor of Enginnering (Software)(Honours). I am highly interested in creativity and learning different ways to view and solve, puzzles and problems that I encounter. In the past i have learnt a variety of programing languages including python, java, c++, etc. and am currently exploring the wide world of web-app development. As I continue to learn and develop through my degree, I am also actively expanding my creativity in theorhetical and practical sistuations. I enjoy many forms of art with no limitation on what I am willing to try. In the past I have dabbled with, woodworking, metal working, forging, book binding, sketching, painting, ink wash art, poetry, riddle making and solving, and so much more.

I am very busy with my studies at the moment but am always open to hearing of possible coloborations with other highly creative indeviduals.

If you have a projct that you think i can help with don't hesitate to contact me via the email below.
